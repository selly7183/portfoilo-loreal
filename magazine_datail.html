							<p>Plus, the tool she uses for depuffing.</p>
							<p>
								It’s been a while since Emily in Paris star Camille Razat has
								had a typical day. The actress and model might be adamant about
								having her coffee (she takes it black) and checking her email
								every morning just like the rest of us, but her life is anything
								but ordinary.
							</p>
							<p>
								“My life is more fast-paced with things happening last minute,”
								she says. “I try to workout every day to maintain a physical and
								mental balance to feel good but I would say I go with the flow.”
							</p>
							<p>
								Fortunately, that flow seems to only be in an upward direction
								as the Parisienne beauty is on the ascend of a successful acting
								career. With several projects in the works, including shooting a
								second season of Emily in Paris and a film directed by Didier D.
								Daarwin, Razat is poised to become a household name. But the new
								L’Oréal Paris spokesperson holds on to some of her rituals, and
								she shared some of her beauty routines, secrets and must-haves
								below.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b
									>What is your earliest memory of experimenting with beauty
									products? </b
								><br />I think I was six or something like that and I used to
								dress myself in my mom’s outfits and wear her makeup. I used to
								prepare shows for my family and believe me, they had to watch!
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Tell us about your daily beauty routine? </b><br />I’m a
								control freak about my skin care routine so I wake up and apply
								my serum and cream. I love the L’Oréal Paris Revitalift Derm
								Intensives 1.5% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum and [Revitalift
								Triple Power Anti-Aging] Moisturizer Fragrance Free. They’re so
								hydrating and plump my skin. Then I use a gua sha to massage and
								depuff my face.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>When it comes to makeup, what are your must-haves? </b
								><br />I don’t use too much makeup and I don’t have much time to
								make myself up these days. I only use a little mix of concealers
								for my dark circles, a blush that I apply to my cheeks and
								eyelids and maybe on my lips. I apply tan powder under my
								cheekbones to add shape to my face and I put on mascara after
								curling my lashes. I love L’Oréal Paris mascaras — Lash Paradise
								[Washable Mascara] makes your lashes look gorgeous. But I can
								spend ten minutes just on my eyebrows [alone]. I like them to be
								wild and fluffy!
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Editor’s tip:</b> The L’Oréal Paris Unbelievabrow Longwear
								Waterproof Brow Gel is a go-to for the busy person who wants
								full, fluffy brows that stay put for up to 48 hours.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>What about your red carpet beauty? </b><br />My red carpet
								looks are far more edgy and sophisticated. I like to dress up
								and have my hair done — in my daily life I’m so bad at doing my
								hair — and put on way more makeup. I love beautiful red lips for
								the red carpet. When I’m on the red carpet I like to think of
								myself as a movie character. I think it’s fun.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Any beauty secrets you can share? </b><br />Drink water!
								Massage your face and body and exercise. Also, for hydrated lips
								always have [antiseptic healing ointment] on you.
